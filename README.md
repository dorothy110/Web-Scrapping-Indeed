# Brief intro: 
Our objective of this project is to give MS Information Program students job-seeking instructions, we analyzed 3 job positions based in 3 cities: Software Developer, UX Programmer, Data Analyst on the Indeed website in San Francisco, Chicago, and New York. In this project, we collected 1500 job data and discussed topics in five aspects:
- Urgent hiring company in recent months
- Talent required at different levels in the job market
   - e.g., entry-level, senior-level, staff level, principal level, etc.
- The top 10 listed skills for DA, UX, SDE
   - SQL,tableau,python...
- The top 10 popular reviewed employers
- Which position is hard to find a job

We accomplished our goal by crawling the data through the site, cleaning it up, and analyzing and visualizing it. The following techniques are applied: Pandas, URlib, RE, requests, Itertools, BS4, Time, Numpy, Plotly, NLP, and Gensim.
